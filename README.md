MathFunction.js
===============

1. Lodge codebase using `npm install`.
2. Verify code integrity with `grunt` (if grunt is not installed, `npm install -g grunt-cli`).
3. Compile library with `node compile`.

This will have generated a (new) `MathFunction.js` and `MathFunction.min.js` (compressed by the Google Closure Compiler, using `node-minify`), which you can use on your page.
