      <p>I know, right? The funny thing is that it doesn't have to be.
      After all, it's 2012, we really, really do have the technology.
      <A href="http://diveintohtml5.info/">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">CSS</a>
      and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> lets us do so much, how hard can it
      be to just write something that lets you put some math on a page
      and have it look good, and plot the function. And make that
      interactive?</p>
      
      <p>Turns out: not that hard, someone just has to do it. So I did,
      and now you can use this on your page too, and maybe we can finally
      get rid of all the gif-image-for-formulae that still poison the
      math-oriented web, or &lt;pre&gt; formatted ASCII. I mean, seriously?</p>
      
      <p>Take the graph on the right. That's the graph for the following
      function:</p>
      
      <p>\[f(t)=\int_{0}^{t} \frac{sin\left ( t \right ) }{1+a \cdot cos\left
       ( b \cdot t-c \cdot sin\left ( d \cdot t \right )  \right ) } \frac{d}{dt}
       , t=[0,2\pi] \]</p>

      <p>Does that function look ugly? No. Because it was converted on-page
      from the LaTeX code for it. You'll never see that code, you just see
      a pretty function, thanks to <a href="http://mathjax.org">MathJax</a>.
      Yeah, that's one of the things we can do these days. Also, see that
      graph? That's a live plot. Go on, click on the little tabs at the
      top or bottom, and then do what comes naturally. Done playing? Click
      the graph to hide all those extra bits.</p>
      
      <p class="sig center">OH MY GOD IT'S INTERACTIVE!</p>
      
      <p>No but seriously, the best part? Click the function in the top
      tab. See that input field? Start typing some math yourself, like
      "sin(t) - cos(t)". Yeah, that's right. You type, it draws. We
      have the technology. We can do this. What about a parametric 
      function, with <i>f(x)</i> and <i>f(y)</i> having separate,
      but same-variabled, function? Just click that checkbox.
      <strong>This is how easy math on the web should be.</strong>
      Show people what you want them to see, and let them play around
      with it. You should use this. You should use this, now.</p>
